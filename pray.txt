Pray Harder
.
You think that prayer will help you here?
Prey? That would be you Darren. 
With a gnashing of teeth a great, black, eight legged creature decends from the ceiling and swallows you whole...
You leap to the ground as a large shadow passes overhead. You really need to find the light switch before it comes back...
Find Light Switch
You pray, but nothing seems to happen...
I wonder if praying harder might work?
Stultus Es Respice Darren! You're getting somewhere!
