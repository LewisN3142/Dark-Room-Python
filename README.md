# The Dark Room Python Version
This is a version of John Robertson's [The Dark Room](https://www.thejohnrobertson.com/thedarkroom/) I coded as a mini-project towards the end of an introductory course in Python at the University of Surrey in 2018. 
At the time, my flatmate and I were mapping out the Youtube version of the game (unfortunately now delisted since it used the Youtube annotations system) and produced a spreadsheet (which I will not add here in-case John is still reusing some of the same routes) which I then began converting into an interactive text adventure in order to practice loops, conditionals, and file IO in the Python syntax. 

In order to run the file, you must have Python (any 3.x version should work) installed on your computer. Then, simply clicking on the ``main.py`` file should run the application in the command line.
