You touch the wall. It's indifferent to you.
Now the first wall is jealous!
You're just some kind of brickwork slut aren't you Darren!
The wall doesn't care Darren! It's a wall!
You weep. This is you: Boo hoo hoo, I'm so alone in this Dark Room...
Oh how helpful Darren! You wet yourself. Nice...
You can't kill yourself Darren, you can't even find the light switch!
