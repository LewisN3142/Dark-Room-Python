Twirl # code as 'you turn around' over and over

At last! Logic has returned to the Dark Room!
You would turn the light switch on with your finger if your finger could see. Can it?
Yes Darren... Your finger can do things that no-one else's can.
And why might that be?
Yes your finger is radioactive Darren, as is the rest of you.In fact it's so radioactive that you've been slowly dying since you awoke. 
The fact that you just typed quit instead of actually quitting shows how much you've lost your grip on reality Darren.
Ok then Darren. You unplug the computer, which just happens to be running the life support machine keeping you alive...
The all-powerful Klaw Strawkcab unfurls from the ceiling and lands on you with a mighty crack. That sounded a lot like 206 bones breaking simultaneously Darren...
We don't condone devil worship here Darren...
You aren't Strawkcab, but the large creature above you is...
Don't self harm Darren, The Dark Room will provide plenty of pain.
You walk forwards
You turn around
Your finger isn't flipping me off because I'm not in the Dark Room. You are in the Dark Room.
Yes Darren, your finger IS normal
What will you do?
